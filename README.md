Database migrations help track and apply schema changes in a structured way, ensuring that the database stays consistent across different environments. They are useful for versioning schema updates and making it easier to roll back changes if needed.

GraphQL differs from REST by allowing flexible and precise data fetching through a single endpoint, while REST uses multiple endpoints for different resources. With GraphQL, clients can specify exactly what data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues common with REST.
